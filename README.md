## Quote Generator Project 5 OpenClassrooms

 Build a random quote generator! The quotes will be randomly constructed by assembling different pieces of a sentence.
 
- The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call
- Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)
- The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)
- Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)
- Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need to different sets of sentences)
- Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
